Our website has seven different pages. The first one is index.html, or our homepage, where the user can navigate to the other six pages in the site. Three of the other pages are to handle accounts and sessions, and the other three are where the user can interact with the mazes. There is a prompt that tells the user who they are logged in as, and it changes as the user clicks the logout button or logs into a new account. If the user is not logged into an account, it will tell the user they are signed in as "Guest". There is also a leaderboard that shows the fastest three times from each maze size across all users, and a table to show your individual fastest time for each maze size.

The maze pages are html pages with a timer, and variable to count the moves made. You can select the maze size from the homepage and then play the maze. To play you must use WASD or the arrow keys to move the green user square to the red exit square. You must navigate the maze and see how quickly you can do it.

The account links called "Login", "Logout", and "Create Account" that are on the homepage are for you to go in and out of your account. You can create as many accounts as you would like. To create an account, click "Create Account" and enter a unique username and a password. You will then be redirected to the "Login" page and you can enter your new info to get into the new account. When you are done, you can select "Logout" and you will then be a Guest until you relogin.
